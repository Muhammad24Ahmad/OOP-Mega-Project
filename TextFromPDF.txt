6 How breast cancer spreads 7 Key points NCCN Guidelines for Patients Invasive Breast Cancer 2024 4 1 Breast cancer basics  The breast Invasive breast cancer is cancer Breast tissue contains glands that can make milk These milk glands are called lobules that has spread from the milk Lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes Small ducts or milk glands into the tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the nipple breast tissue or nearby lymph nodes The ring of darker breast skin is called the areola The raised tip within the areola is called the nipple The nipple-areola complex NAC is a term that refers to both parts The breast Lymph drains from breast tissue into lymph vessels and travels to lymph nodes near your The breast is an organ and a gland found armpit axilla Lymph is a clear fluid that on the chest The breast is made of milk gives cells water and food It also helps to ducts fat nerves lymph and blood vessels fight germs Nodes near the armpit are called ligaments and other connective tissue Behind axillary lymph nodes ALNs the breast is the pectoral chest muscle and ribs Muscle and ligaments help hold the breast in place The breast The breast is a glandular organ made up of milk ducts fat nerves blood and lymph vessels ligaments and other connective tissue NCCN Guidelines for Patients Invasive Breast Cancer 2024 5 11 BBrreeaasstt ccaanncceerr bbaassiiccss  BBrreeaasstt ccaanncceerr  How breast cancer spreads Breast cancer Metastasis Unlike normal cells cancer cells can spread Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast and form tumors in other parts of the body Almost all breast cancers are a subtype called called metastases In this process cancer carcinomas Carcinomas are cancers that cells break away from the first primary tumor start in the cells that line the inner or outer and travel through blood or lymph vessels to surfaces of the body There are different types distant sites Once in other sites cancer cells of breast carcinoma most of which arise in may form secondary tumors cells that make up the lining epithelial cells in the terminal duct lobular units TDLUs of  Cancer that has spread to a nearby body the breast The most common types are either part such as the axillary lymph nodes ductal or lobular is called a local metastasis It might be referred to as localregional disease or Anyone can develop breast cancer including locally advanced those assigned male at birth Although there are some differences between those assigned  Cancer that has spread to a body part far male and those assigned female at birth from the primary tumor is called a distant treatment is very similar for all genders metastasis Breast cancer can metastasize almost How breast cancer spreads anywhere but most commonly spreads to the bone including spine lungs liver brain or distant lymph nodes Breast cancer that has Cancer cells dont behave like normal cells metastasized to other parts of the body is still Cancer cells differ from normal cells in the called breast cancer following ways More information on metastatic breast cancer Primary tumor is available at NCCNorgpatientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app Over time cancer cells form a mass called a primary tumor Invasive Cancer cells can grow into surrounding tissues Invasive breast cancer is breast cancer that has spread from the milk ducts or milk glands lobules into the surrounding breast tissue or nearby lymph nodes NCCN Guidelines for Patients Invasive Breast Cancer 2024 66 1 Breast cancer basics  Key points Key points  Metastatic breast cancer MBC has spread outside the breast and lymph  Anyone can develop breast cancer but nodes under the arm axilla breast cancer occurs more frequently in persons assigned female at birth  Inside breasts are lobules ducts fat blood and lymph vessels ligaments and connective tissue Lobules are structures that make breast milk Ducts carry breast milk from the lobules to the nipple  Breast cancer arises from epithelial cells cells that make up the lining in the terminal duct lobular units TDLUs of the breast  Invasive breast cancer is cancer that has grown outside the ducts or lobules into surrounding tissue Once outside the ducts or lobules breast cancer can spread through lymph or blood to lymph nodes or other parts of the body Anyone can develop breast cancer including those

cancer  Test results Not all invasive breast cancers Testing takes time It might take are the same Treatment planning days or weeks for all test results starts with testing Your care team to come in will want to gather information about the cancer you have This chapter presents an overview of  Organize your papers Create files for the tests you might receive and insurance forms medical records and what to expect test results You can do the same on your computer  Keep a list of contact information for everyone on your care team Add it Test results to your phone Hang the list on your refrigerator or keep it in a place where Results from biopsy and imaging studies will someone can access it in an emergency be used to determine your treatment plan Keep your primary care physician PCP Treatment will be based on these findings It informed of changes to this list You are is important you understand what these tests encouraged to keep your PCP in the loop mean Ask questions and keep copies of your They are great partners in your care test results  In your contact list include information on the exact type of cancer you have as well Keep these things in mind as any treatments youve received and the date each treatment started  Choose a friend family member or peer who can drive you to appointments  Set up a MyChart or health record provide meals or offer emotional support account if its available which can help during diagnosis and treatment you keep track your appointments and communicate with your care team  Bring someone with you to doctor visits if possible For possible tests see Guide 1  Write down questions and take notes during appointments Dont be afraid to ask your care team questions Get to know your care team and help them get to know you  Get copies

General health tests Family history Some cancers and other diseases can run Medical history in families Your care team will ask about the health history of family members who are A medical history is a record of all health blood relatives This information is called a issues and treatments you have had in your family history Ask family members on both life Be prepared to list any illness or injury sides of your family about their health issues and when it happened Bring a list of old and like heart disease cancer and diabetes new medicines and any over-the-counter and at what age they were diagnosed Its OTC medicines herbals or supplements you important to know the specific type of cancer take Some supplements interact and affect or where the cancer started and if it is in medicines that your care team may prescribe multiple locations and if they had genetic Tell your care team about any symptoms you testing have A medical history sometimes called a health history will help determine which treatment is best for you Guide 1 Possible tests Medical history and physical exam Diagnostic mammogram Other imaging tests as needed Biopsy with pathology review Determine tumor

If you ovaries and damage sperm If you become think you want children in the future ask your pregnant during chemotherapy radiation care team how cancer and cancer treatment therapy or other types of systemic therapy might change your fertility To preserve your serious birth defects can occur Speak with your fertility you may need to take action before care team about preventing pregnancy while starting cancer treatment Those who want to being treated for cancer Hormonal birth control have children in the future should be referred may or may not be recommended so ask to a fertility specialist to discuss the options your doctor about options such as intrauterine before starting treatment devices IUDs and barrier methods Types of barrier methods include condoms diaphragms Fertility preservation is all about keeping your cervical caps and the contraceptive sponge options open whether you know you want to have children later in life or arent sure at the Those with

condoms to prevent pregnancy made or processed by the liver Levels that during and immediately after cancer treatment are too high or low signal that the liver is not working well or that cancer has spread to the liver It is common to see a mild increase in Blood tests LFTs during chemotherapy Blood tests check for signs of disease and Pregnancy test how well organs are working They require Those who can become pregnant will be given a sample of your blood which is removed a pregnancy test before treatment begins through a needle placed into your vein Alkaline phosphatase Alkaline phosphatase ALP is an enzyme found in the blood High levels of ALP can be a sign cancer has spread to the bone or liver A bone scan might be performed if you have high levels of ALP Complete blood count A complete blood count CBC measures the levels of red blood cells RBCs white blood cells WBCs and platelets PLTs in your blood Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body white blood cells fight infection and platelets control bleeding Comprehensive metabolic panel A comprehensive metabolic panel CMP measures 14 different substances in your blood It is usually done on the plasma part of your blood A CMP provides important information about how well your kidneys and liver are working among other things NCCN Guidelines for Patients Invasive Breast Cancer 2024 13 2 Testing for breast cancer  Imaging tests Imaging tests issues Your care team may order x-rays if your bones hurt or were abnormal on a bone scan Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of your body Imaging tests show the primary Contrast material tumor or where the cancer started and look for cancer in other parts of the body Contrast materials are not dyes but substances that help make the pictures of the A radiologist an expert in interpreting imaging inside of the body clearer The contrast is not tests will write a report and send this report to permanent and will leave the body in your your health care provider HCP It is likely that urine after the test There is more than one the report will be sent directly to you through type of contrast and it differs depending on your patient portal or patient access system the test Tell your care team if you have had You should discuss these results with your allergic reactions to contrast in the past This HCP is important You might be given medicines to avoid the effects of those allergies The following imaging tests are listed in alphabetical order and not in order of CT scan importance You will not have all these tests A computed tomography CT or CAT scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take Bone scan pictures of the inside of the body It takes many A bone scan uses a radiotracer A radiotracer x-rays of the same body part from different is a substance that releases small amounts of angles All the images are combined to make radiation Before the pictures are taken the one detailed picture A CT scan of your chest tracer will be injected into your vein It can take abdomen andor pelvis might be one of the a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones tests used to look for cancer Intravenous IV However the test is quick and painless contrast is often used A special camera will take pictures of the Diagnostic mammogram tracer in your bones as it moves over your body Areas of bone damage take up more A mammogram is a picture of the inside of radiotracer than healthy bone and show up your breast The picture is made using x-rays as bright spots on the pictures Bone damage A computer combines the x-rays to make can be caused by cancer cancer treatment detailed pictures Mammogram results are previous injuries or other health issues used to plan treatment Diagnostic mammograms look at specific Bone x-ray areas of your breasts which may not be An x-ray uses low-dose radiation to take one clearly seen on screening mammograms It is picture at a time A tumor changes the way used to see tumor and the size of the tumors radiation is absorbed and will show up on the Diagnostic mammograms include extra x-ray X-rays are also good at showing bone compression in certain areas of the breast NCCN Guidelines for Patients Invasive Breast Cancer 2024 14 2 Testing for breast cancer  Imaging tests magnification views or rolling the breast to image additional areas of the breast Other Whats the difference diagnostic tests may include a breast MRI or ultrasound between a screening and diagnostic mammogram MRI scan A mammogram is a picture of the inside A magnetic resonance imaging MRI scan of your breast made using x-rays During uses radio waves and powerful magnets to a mammogram the breast is pressed take pictures of the inside of the body It does between two plates while you stand in not use x-rays Because of the very strong different positions Multiple x-rays will be magnets used in the MRI machine tell the taken A computer combines the x-rays to technologist if you have any metal in your make detailed pictures body During the test you will likely be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the images Contrast is  Screening mammograms are done often used on a regular basis when there are no signs or symptoms of breast cancer A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where Results take a few days the magnet surrounds you An open MRI has  Diagnostic mammograms are a magnetic top and bottom which allows for used for those who have symptoms an opening on each end Closed MRIs are such as a lump pain nipple thickening more common than open MRIs so if you have or discharge or whose breasts have claustrophobia a dread or fear of enclosed spaces be sure to talk to your care team changed shape or size about it  Diagnostic mammograms are also used to take a closer look at an  A breast MRI might be used in addition abnormal area found in a screening to a mammogram Contrast should be mammogram used You will be positioned face down in the machine with your arms above your  A radiologist will evaluate the head diagnostic mammogram while you  A spine or brain MRI can be used wait so if additional testing is needed it to detect breast cancer that has spread can be done right away metastasize to your spine or brain For a Both types of mammograms use low-dose brain MRI a device is placed around your x-rays to examine the breast They may head For a spine MRI no device is worn use either the standard 2-dimensional 2D Contrast should be used in an MRI digital mammogram or 3-dimensional 3D mammogram known as tomosynthesis NCCN Guidelines for Patients Invasive Breast Cancer 2024 15 2 Testing for breast cancer  Biopsy PET scan Ultrasound A positron emission tomography PET scan An ultrasound US uses high-energy sound uses a radioactive drug called a tracer A waves to form pictures of the inside of the tracer is a substance injected into a vein to body This is similar to the sonogram used for see where cancer cells are in the body and if pregnancy A wand-like probe transducer will they are using sugar produced by your body be held and moved on your bare breast using to grow Cancer cells show up as bright spots gel It may also be placed below your armpit on PET scans However not all tumors will Ultrasound does not use x-rays It is good at appear on a PET scan Also not all bright showing small areas of cancer that are near spots are cancer It is normal for the brain the skin Sometimes a breast ultrasound or heart kidneys and bladder to be bright on MRI is used to guide a biopsy PET Inflammation or infection can also show up as a bright spot When a PET scan is combined with CT it is called a PETCT scan Biopsy  An FDG PETCT uses a radiotracer A biopsy is a procedure that removes a sample called F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose FDG It of tissue or fluid The sample is sent to a lab is made of fluoride and a simple form of for testing A pathologist will examine the sugar called glucose You cannot eat or biopsy for cancer and write a report called a drink for at least 4 hours before the scan pathology report Ask questions about your This scan is most helpful when other biopsy results and what it means for your imaging results are unclear It may help treatment find cancer in lymph nodes and distant sites If it clearly shows cancer in the There are different types of biopsies Some bone a bone scan and sodium fluoride biopsies are guided using imaging such as PETCT may not be needed FDG-PET mammogram ultrasound or MRI The primary CT can be done at the same time as a CT or main tumor is biopsied first Other tumors or used for diagnosis tumors in different areas may also be biopsied  A FES-PETCT might be used instead You may have tissue removed from the breast of FDG-PETCT when cancer is estrogen lymph nodes or both receptor-positive ER FES is a radioactive form of the hormone estrogen Types of possible biopsies include  A sodium fluoride PETCT might be  Fine-needle aspiration FNA or used instead of a bone scan In this test core biopsy CB uses needles of the radiotracer is made of sodium fluoride different sizes to remove a sample of tissue or fluid In a vacuum-assisted core biopsy VACB suction is used to remove the sample with a special vacuum device NCCN Guidelines for Patients Invasive Breast Cancer 2024 16 2 Testing for breast cancer  Biopsy  Incisional biopsy removes a small Axillary lymph node needle biopsy amount of tissue through a small cut in An axillary lymph node ALN drains lymph the skin or body fluid from the breast and nearby areas In an  Excisional biopsy removes the entire axillary lymph node biopsy a sample of lymph abnormal area This is not the preferred node near the armpit axilla is biopsied with type of biopsy but may be necessary a needle This is to determine if abnormal if other methods are not possible or lymph nodes seen on imaging tests contain when the biopsy results dont match the cancer cells An ultrasound-guided fine-needle expected findings aspiration US-FNA or core biopsy will be used If cancer is found it is called node Before biopsies are performed usually the positive node A marker may be placed in area is injected with numbing medicine A core the node so that it can be identified later if needle biopsy CNB removes more than one needed tissue sample but usually through the same area on the breast The samples are small Biopsy results The needle is often guided into the tumor with imaging When mammography is used during Histology is the study of the anatomy a biopsy it is called a stereotactic needle structure of cells tissues and organs under biopsy a microscope It is used to make treatment decisions Your pathology report will contain One or more clips may be placed near the information about histology breast tumor during a biopsy The clips are small painless and made of metal They will You may be recommended to have an open mark the site for future treatment and imaging biopsy surgery to remove excise the tumor The clips stay in place until surgery If the area to confirm histology Talk to your health care biopsied is benign the clip will remain in place provider for more information on next steps to mark the biopsy site on future imaging The clips cause no problems even if they are left in place for a long time You will be able to go through airport security and have an MRI with the clips in place There are both physical and emotional experiences in having biopsies You may need to rest and place an ice pack on the biopsy area after the procedure If you are working or have other commitments you may want to take the day off to rest NCCN Guidelines for Patients Invasive Breast Cancer 2024 17 2 Testing for breast cancer  Hormone receptor status Hormone receptor status Hormone receptor-positive In hormone receptor-positive HR Your blood carries hormones throughout your breast cancer IHC finds estrogen andor body A hormone is a substance made by a progesterone hormone receptors Most breast gland in your body A receptor is a protein cancers are HR found inside or on the surface of a cell When hormones attach bind to specific receptors it  Estrogen receptor ER is stimulated causes changes within the cell by estrogen and provides survival and proliferation rapid growth signals When hormones attach to receptors inside Cancer cells deprived of estrogen or breast cancer cells they can cause cancer that have their ER signal blocked with to grow If found these receptors may be treatment may stop growing or die targeted using endocrine therapy  Progesterone receptor PR binds There are 2 types of hormone receptors progesterone and provides survival and proliferation signals It is thought that PR  Estrogen  plays a role in breast expression also suggests the tumor is development estrogen dependent  Progesterone  plays a role in HR breast cancer is treated with endocrine menstrual cycle and pregnancy therapy which blocks estrogen receptor signaling or decreases estrogen production Hormone receptor HR testing should be done on any new tumors A biopsy sample will be used Estrogen receptor-positive ER Immunohistochemistry breast cancer cells Immunohistochemistry IHC is a special staining process that involves adding a  In ER breast cancer testing finds chemical marker to cells These cells are then estrogen hormone receptors in at least studied using a microscope IHC can find 1 out of every 100 cancer cells estrogen progesterone and HER2 receptors  In ER-lowpositive invasive breast in breast cancer cells A pathologist will cancer testing finds estrogen hormone measure how many cells have estrogen and or progesterone receptors and the number of receptors in 1 to 10 out of every 100 receptors inside each cell cancer cells  Endocrine therapy might not be recommended for ER-lowpositive invasive breast cancer NCCN Guidelines for Patients Invasive Breast Cancer 2024 18 2 Testing for breast cancer  HER2 status Hormone receptor-negative Hormone receptor-negative HR- breast Treatment options by cell cancer cells do not have either estrogen or progesterone hormone receptors These receptor type cancers are sometimes simply called hormone negative HR- cancers often grow faster There are many treatments for invasive than HR cancers Both the estrogen and breast cancer Which ones are right for you progesterone receptors need to be negative for are based on many factors Two important breast cancer to be considered HR- factors are the hormone receptor HR and HER2 status of any tumors HER2 status  Hormone receptors include estrogen and progesterone A tumor is considered Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 hormone receptor-positive HR if an HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell increased number of estrogen receptors growth It is found on the surface of all cells progesterone receptors or both are When amounts are high it causes cells to found grow and divide Some breast cancers have too many HER2 genes or receptors Too many  HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell HER2s is called HER2-positive HER2 You growth There might be higher amounts might hear it called HER2 overexpression or of HER2 in your breast cancer If this amplification is the case it is called HER2-positive HER2 breast cancer There are 2 tests for HER2 Endocrine therapy stops cancer growth  Immunohistochemistry IHC caused by hormones It is a standard measures receptors If the IHC score is treatment for hormone receptor-positive 3 the cancer is HER2 If the score is 0 HR cancers HR cancer can be estrogen or 1 it is considered HER2- If the score receptor-positive ER andor progesterone is 2 further testing is needed receptor-positive PR  In situ hybridization ISH counts the HER2-targeted therapy is a standard number of copies of the HER2 gene This treatment for HER2 cancers test is done mainly when the IHC score is unclear Chemotherapy is often the first treatment HER2 testing should be done on all new for hormone receptor-negative HR- tumors A tumor biopsy sample will be used cancers You might have more than one HER2 test NCCN Guidelines for Patients Invasive Breast Cancer 2024 19 2 Testing for breast cancer  Biomarker testing Biomarker testing Tumor markers Your blood or biopsy tissue may be tested A sample from a biopsy of your tumor for proteins These proteins are called may be tested to look for specific DNA tumor markers Knowing this information deoxyribonucleic acid mutationsalterations can help plan treatment Examples of some protein levels or other molecular features tumor markers in breast cancer include This information is used to choose the best carcinoembryonic antigen CEA CA 15-3 and treatment for you It is sometimes called CA 2729 An increase in the level of certain molecular testing or tumor profiling tumor tumor markers could mean that the cancer has sequencing gene expression profiling or grown or spread progressed However not genomic testing everyone has elevated levels of these markers and tumor markers alone are not a reliable Biomarker testing includes tests of genes method of detecting breast cancer Therefore or their products proteins It identifies they are not routinely checked and depend on the presence or absence of mutations and your individual situation certain proteins that might suggest treatment Proteins are written like this BRCA Genes are written with italics like this BRCA HER2 and hormone receptor status are part of biomarker testing Your treatment team will recommend the best types of biomarker testing that are important for you Biomarker testing or mutation testing is more commonly done in metastatic breast cancer Tumor mutation testing A sample of your tumor or blood may be used to see if the cancer cells have any specific DNA mutations This is a different type of DNA testing than the genetic testing for mutations you may have inherited from your biological parents In tumor mutation testing only the tumor is tested and not the rest of your body Certain mutations such as PIK3CA can be targeted with specific therapies NCCN Guidelines for Patients Invasive Breast Cancer 2024 20 2 Testing for breast

your cancer your health care Some cancers and other diseases run in provider might refer you for hereditary genetic familiesthose who are related to you testing to learn more about your cancer A through genes passed down from biological genetic counselor or trained provider will speak parent to child This information is called to you about the results Test results may be a family health history Ask blood relatives used to guide treatment planning about their health issues like heart disease cancer and diabetes and at what age they Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva were diagnosed For relatives who were spitting into a cup or a cheek swab The diagnosed with cancer ask them or other goal is to look for gene mutations inherited relatives if they are no longer living what from your biological parents called germline mutations Some mutations can put you at type of cancer they had if they died from risk for more than one type of cancer You the cancer and at what age the cancer was can pass these genes on to your children diagnosed Also other blood relatives might carry these mutations Tell your care team if there is a Start by asking your parents siblings family history of cancer and children Next talk to half-siblings aunts and uncles nieces and nephews BRCA tests grandparents and grandchildren Everyone has BRCA genes Normal BRCA Write down what you learn about your genes help to prevent tumor growth They help family history and share with your health fix damaged cells and help cells grow normally care provider BRCA mutations put you at risk for more than one type of cancer Mutations in BRCA1 or Some of the questions to ask include BRCA2 increase the risk of breast ovarian prostate pancreatic and melanoma skin 3 How old were you when each of these

axillary nodes are removed with the breast it is called a modified radical mastectomy Sentinel lymph node biopsy Sentinel lymph node biopsy SLNB or SNB is There are 3 levels of axillary lymph nodes done during a lumpectomy or mastectomy to determine if any cancer cells have traveled to  Level I  nodes located below the lower the lymph nodes The lymph nodes removed edge of the chest muscle are called the sentinel nodes  Level II  nodes located underneath the chest muscle A sentinel lymph node SLN is the first lymph node or nodes that cancer cells are most likely  Level III  nodes located above the to spread to from a primary tumor Often there chest muscle near the collarbone is more than one sentinel lymph node Just because these nodes are removed it does not An ALND usually removes level I and II axillary mean that they test positive for cancer lymph nodes For more information about the timing of biopsies talk with your care team To find the sentinel lymph nodes a dye is injected into the breast It may be a radioactive material blue dye or other tracer The tracer travels through the lymph channels in the breast to the lymph nodes in the armpit This helps the surgeon find which of the lymph nodes are the sentinel lymph nodes The lymph nodes containing the tracer are removed and tested by a pathologist Axillary lymph node dissection Axillary lymph node dissection ALND is surgery to remove axillary lymph nodes This is performed after an axillary lymph node biopsy or SLNB shows cancer in the lymph nodes called node positive Then an ALND will remove any other lymph nodes that contain cancer Removing lymph nodes can cause lymphedema and other health issues NCCN Guidelines for Patients Invasive Breast Cancer 2024 36 4 Treating breast cancer  Lymph node

something to look other parts of the body and may be completed like a nipple it will not have the sensation of in a single surgery This technique called a your real nipple Also a tattoo can be done to Goldilocks mastectomy is best suited for those look like a nipple without having to take tissue with larger breasts who are willing to have from another part of the body much smaller breasts as a result Breasts can be remade using tissue from other parts of your body known as flaps These flaps are taken from the abdomen buttocks thigh or from under the shoulder blade Some flaps are completely removed and then sewn in place Other flaps stay attached to your body but are slid over and sewn into place There are several risks associated with flaps including death of fat in the flap which can cause lumps A hernia may result from muscle weakness Problems are more likely to occur among those who have diabetes or who smoke Implants and flaps Some breasts are reconstructed with both implants and flaps This method may give the reconstructed breast more volume to match the other breast For any reconstruction you may need surgery on your remaining breast to match the two breasts in size and
